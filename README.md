Data Management Plan for the research project Biogeochemical model of the Columbia River Estuary.

Context of the project: Spring wheat to accelerate introgression of herbicide resistance from Colorado hard red winter to soft white winter

Colorado State University (CSU) developed a new source of herbicide resistance conferring resistance to quizalofop herbicides in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Quizalofop fits the criteria for an ideal herbicide since it does not leave have the long lasting soil residual that Beyond™ does but still controls the grassy weeds by inhibiting the acetyl co-A carboxylase enzyme. CSU developed the new herbicide resistant non-GMO wheat through induced mutagenesis (Ostlie et al. 2015). The mutation was induced in two of the three copies of this gene found in wheat to confer a greater level of tolerance to the herbicide. CSU developed this herbicide resistance in wheat cultivars that are adapted to Colorado environmental conditions but not adapted to the growing environment in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) especially resistance to diseases prevalent in the PNW such a stripe rust (Puccina striiformis). Therefore, there is a great need to quickly produce wheat varieties carrying this new source of herbicide resistance that are suitable for the millions of acres of wheat in the PNW. 

Many field crops take years to develop new varieties since only 1-3 generations can be done a year. The concept of “speed breeding” where new techniques and protocols are employed to accelerate the breeding process are being developed. We are using spring wheat as part of the breeding scheme to produce a winter wheat variety from another winter wheat variety.
By crossing OSU’s SWS wheat with CSU’s CoAxium HRW wheat and continuing to backcross with spring wheat, the generation time is shortened by 6 weeks per generation. The last few crosses of the scheme will be with OSU’s SWW wheat where only the soft and glutenin genes will need to be selected for potentially shortening the breeding scheme by 4 months compared to the control or conventional scheme.

Markers will be used to identify 2 of the 3 resistance genes, seed color, hardness, and glutenin genes.
Dates recorded keeping track of generation times of the two breeding schemes to compare time
quality test at the end to see if the two breeding schemes produced similar cultivars
