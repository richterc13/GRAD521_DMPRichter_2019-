Spring wheat to accelerate introgression of herbicide resistance from Colorado hard red winter wheat to soft white winter wheat

# Data description
	Data recorded will include dates of planting for each generation, anthesis, and harvest. This data will be studied through observation and recorded in a table with the date and variety name on an Excel file. The plants will be grown in green houses on OSU's campus to maintain near constant and ideal growing conditions, with the conditions recorded. To genotype the plants, tissue samples of each individual will be collected and used for phenol-chloroform DNA extraction. Kompetative Allele Specific PCR (KASP) will be used to read the extracted DNA in a StepOne machine for various genes and then recorded in a table stating whether the gene was present or not on Excel. The genes that will be tested for include seed color, herbicide resistance, and resistance to PNW diseases. Molecular markers and primers will be used (with KASP) to identify the resistance genes and quality genes. Excel files will also be made to keep a record of the specific crosses made between individual plants. Laboratory notebooks will be used to record observations, procedures and other ideas throughout the project. This dataset will be around 2 or 3 MB. This experiment will occur over the course of about two years. The study started November 2017 and has a goal end date of November 2019.

# Roles and responsibilities
Colette Richter is in charge of keeping track of the dates of planting, harvest and anthesis, extracting DNA, data description, a laboratory notebook, metadata generation, quality control for the methods/work flow and data analysis. Two lab technicians (Lab techs 1 and 2) and Richter are in charge of the genotyping data and overall data organization. Lab techs 1 is in charge of the molecular marker data and primers to identify the traits being selected as well as instrumentation maintenance, software creation and maintenance if needed, and access control. Lab tech 2 helps with quality control for the plants, making sure the plants stay a live and healthy with fertilizer, herbicides etc. in order for the data collection to go smoothly. Overall, Richter does most of the data collection since it is her thesis, but Lab techs 1 and 2 also help when needed.

The PI will help with the access control of the publication as well as quality control of the thesis. Archiving and preservation of data will go through the PI as well as through another one of his faculty assistants. The data will be unrestricted data since the main objective of this research is to provide other plant breeders with a potentially faster breeding scheme for wheat. There are no data management or data sharing requirements of the lab, however these tasks are performed on a regular basis so it the information can be easily found if needed. There are also no disclosure agreements.

If someone were to leave the project could continue. Lab tech 1 and 2 have similar skills and could take over if the other were to leave. There are also other faculty that can help as well. If the PI leaves and a new PI steps in and wishes to continue the project, it could also be easily continued. The project could also be stopped and continued later on since all of the seed from each individual of each generation is saved. 

In order to hold everyone accountable for their responsibilities, laboratory notebooks are kept and updated regularly, initials are made on Word and Excel sheets to note who entered the data or metadata. Monthly meetings will occur in order to keep strong communication.

# Data standards and metadata
The OSU Wheat Breeding lab does not have a data or a metadata standard. There are no metadata requirements for the lab. It is a general plant breeding program that does not perform a lot of research unless it is through the graduate students. Therefore, it is up to the graduate students on how they wish to store and create their metadata as well as their data. AgMES provides access to bibliographic information on agricultural science and technology and was developed by the FAO. It has the goal of providing global public data in multiple languages through access to publications, journal articles, book chapters and more; this metadata standard will be used and submitted there.

Zotero is used to manage data for reference article to create files for different topics and chapters of my thesis and potentially metadata. Data including the dates (planting, anthesis, harvest) will be kept on an Excel file that will include a section for metadata. These documents will be kept on a personal laptop as well as on the lab’s R drive, a stoarge drive that is backed up and maintained by Roots IT Support group at OSU. The R drive is where there is shared information for all of the projects going on in the Wheat Breeding program. The metadata for this project will be kept in a personal laboratory notebook and in sections on some of the Word and Excel files on the R drive. Metadata will include the greenhouse conditions, any changes to the methods or materials and why, the parental backgrounds of the final products, explainations of why some parental backgrounds did not work, general information about the StepOne machine that runs KASP that affects the proejct, DNA concentrations from DNA concentrations, dates of when tasks were performed, and information about plant health and vigor.

# Storage and security
The data will be stored on the lab's R drive and on a personal laptop. The R drive is the shared network that can be accessed directly through the lab's computers or if given permission, through a personal computer. The shared network is backed up by Roots IT Support which contains a back up drive for all information if needed. That way the data is stored in two completely seperate sources. The R drive will contain files from Word, Excel, as well as other formats such as specific files that come from StepOne machine. There will be an Excel file version that carries the same information as the StepOne machine. There are multiple copies in different formats of the information collected for DNA collection and genotyping. The metadata and thesis will be saved on the graduate student's perosnal laptop, as well as googledrive, as well as on the R drive. The thesis will be written on the googledrive, and then at the end of each writing session, will be saved onto the desktop and replace the previous thesis file. The file will then be added to the R drive and then replace the previous thesis file.

Any information on the personal laptop will be permenatley saved and be backed up using a "time machine". The informaiton on the R drive will be saved forever, but some files may be condensed in a few years. Only the important documents are maintained but as a breeding program, files tend to be saved to look back on information on different varieties. 

# Access and data sharing
There are no factors that will restrict the sharing of the data my group has produced. Although we may not publish all of our data, if someone was curious, for example, how many herbicide resistant plants we had for each generation of breeding, we could easily look that up and share it. A chart of the other desired genes that were carried through each generation of breeding may also be created. The CoAxium Wheat was originally created by Colorado Wheat Research Foundation and owns the patent on the herbicide resistance gene. Therefore, my PI had to pay a trait fee to get seeds to work with but I do not have any restrictions for my project.

Some of the data will be publicly available when I publish my thesis. The rest will be available through a supplementary file or upon request. My thesis and research has to do with a potential new breeding scheme so documenting and its progression is the most important data that I can make that publicly available once I publish my thesis. Since we created our own KASP markers to run our DNA samples (and see which genes they carry) we can share the marker and primer data. In terms of policies governing the reuse, redistribution and creation of derivatives of the data/licenses, there will not be any policies for the data I generate. There is only a limitation on sharing the germplasm we produce with other breeding institutions. Anyone who requests to use the germplasm will need a license, similar to what we had to acquire at the start of our project.

There is a server (the “R” drive) that our lab has accessed to and is backed up and supported through ROOTS. I will have control and access of my data and will be available to others in my group as well. The data will be archived and preserved forever. The formats will be in Excel, Word and StepOne files (the format that the StepOne machine uses and detects the presence of certain genes/alleles, can also export data into Excel files).
