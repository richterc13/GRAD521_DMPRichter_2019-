Spring wheat to accelerate introgression of herbicide resistance from Colorado hard red winter wheat to soft white winter wheat

A
# Data description
Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is grown on over four million acres in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as it is one of the only economically viable crops in areas of low or intermediate rainfall. Herbicide resistant varieties are important in growing wheat in the PNW due to the highly competitive weeds such as jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) which are the leading to losses in quality and quantity. Colorado State University (CSU) developed a new source of herbicide resistance conferring resistance to Quizalofop P herbicides in wheat. Due to winter wheat’s longer life cycle compared to spring wheat, CSU’s winter herbicide resistant variety will be crossed with Oregon State University’s (OSU) spring wheat. After about four or five generations of backcrossing the progeny to the OSU spring white wheat, the plants will be crossed to OSU’s winter wheat in an attempt to speed up the breeding process. This breeding scheme will be compared to a conventional breeding scheme, where CSU’s resistant varieties are directly crossed to OSU’s winter wheat varieties until the desired resistant winter wheat that is adapted to Oregon’s climate and stressors is developed. The goal is to study whether wheat breeding schemes can be sped up by using spring wheat to decrease the amount of time needed to create a new winter wheat variety.
	To compare the speed of the two breeding schemes, data will be recorded for the dates of planting for each generation, anthesis, and harvest. This data will be studied through observation and recorded in a table with date on the x-axis and the variety on the y-axis. This dataset will be about 1 MB. In addition, genotyping the end results for various genes (about 30), such as disease resistance, will be used to compare the final products of the two schemes to see if anything was gained or lost using the speed breeding method as well as overall quality of the final products. The plants will be grown in green houses on OSU's campus to maintain near constant and ideal growing conditions. To genotype the plants, tissue samples of each individual will be collected and used for phenol-chloroform DNA extraction. Kompetative Allele Specific PCR (KASP) will be used to read the extracted DNA for the various genes and then recorded in a table stating whether the gene was present or not on Excel. Molecular markers will be used (with KASP) to identify the resistance genes as well as the other quality genes such as disease resistance, hardness, seed color, and glutenin content. Excel files will also be made to keep a record of the specific crosses made between individual plants. This dataset will be around 2 or 3 MB, potentially more if the exact PCR results are included. This experiment will occur over the course of about two years. The study started November 2017 and has a goal end date of November 2019. 

# Roles and responsibilities
Colette Richter is in charge of keeping track of the dates of planting, harvest and anthesis and extracting DNA. Two lab technicians (Lab techs 1 and 2) and Richter are in charge of the genotyping data, greenhouse maintenace, such as watering and putting winter wheat in and out of the vernalization chamber, and overall data organization. Lab techs 1 and 2 and Richter are all in charge of the molecular marker data and primers to identify the traits being selected. Overall, Richter does most of the data collection since it is her thesis, but Lab techs 1 and 2 also help when needed. Richter is also incharge of data description, a lab notebook, quality control for the methods.work flow and data analysis. Lab tech 1 primarily does instrumentation maintenance, software creation and maintenance if needed, and access control. Lab tech 2 helps with quality control for the plants, making sure the plants stay a live and healthy with fertilizer, herbicides etc. in order for the data collection to go smoothly.

The PI will step in and help with the access control of the publication as well as quality control of the thesis. The data will unrestricted data since the main objective of this research is to provide other plant breeders with a potential new, faster breeding scheme for wheat. There are no data management or data sharing requirements of the lab, however these tasks are performed on a regular basis so it the information can be easily found if needed. There are also no disclosure agreements. Richter will be doing the metadata generation. Archiving and preservation of data will go through my PI as well as through another one of his faculty assistants.

If someone were to leave the project could continue. Lab tech 1 and 2 have similar skills and could take over if the other were to leave. There are also other faculty that can help as well. If the PI leaves, then if a new PI steps in and wishes to continue the project it could also be easily continued. The project could also be stopped and continued later on since all of the seed from each individual of each generation is saved. 

There is no exact method or plan for ensuring others do their part except for holding each other accountable and maintaining strong communication. However, on some of our data sheets, there is a column for initials.

# Data standards and metadata
The OSU Wheat Breeding lab does not have a data or a metadata standard. AgMES provides access to bibliographic information on agricultural science and technology and was developed by the FAO. It has the goal of providing global public data in multiple languages through access to publications, journal articles, book chapters and more; the metadata will be submitted there.

Zotero is used to manage data for reference article to create files for different topics and chapters of my thesis. For the hard data, the dates (planting, anthesis, harvest) will be kept on an EXCEL file that will include a section for notes or metadata. These documents will be kept on a personal laptop as well as on the lab’s R drive, a stoarge drive that is backed up and maintained by Roots IT Support group at OSU. The R drive is where there is shared information for all of the projects going on in the Wheat Breeding program. There are no metadata requirements for the lab. It is a general plant breeding program that does not perform a lot of research unless it is through the graduate students. Therefore, it is up to the graduate students on how they wish to store and create their metadata as well as their data. The metadata for this project will be kept in a personal lab notebook and in sections on some of the Word and Excel files on the R drive. Metadata will include the greenhouse conditions, any changes to the methods or materials and why, the parental backgrounds of the final products, explainations of why some parental backgrounds did not work, general information about the StepOne machine that runs KASP that affects the proejct, DNA concentrations from DNA concentrations, dates of when tasks were performed, and information about plant health and vigor.

# Storage and security
My data will be stored on my lab's R drive and on my own personal laptop. The R drive is the shared network that can be accessed directly through the lab's computers or if given permission, through a personal computer. That way my data is stored in two completely seperate sources. The R drive will contain files from Word, Excel, as well as other formats such as specific files that come from PCR macheines that have another version with the same informaitno on an excel and a word document. We have multiple copies in different formats of the information we collect, mainly for DNA and genotyping. My metadata and thesis will be saved on my perosnal laptop, as well as googledrive, but not on the R drive. In these ways, I have at least two copies of each source of information I need for my research and thesis. I am not sure if there is a way to edit lets say the google doc version of my thesis and have it automatically update the word version on y laptop, but as of now i have been copying and pasting the most recent version to the other, or i can download the google doc version under the same file name as my thesis on my laptop and just replace it. The shared network is backed up by Roots IT Support which contains a back up drive for all information if needed.

Any information on my laptop will be saved forever and will be backed up again using a "time machine". The informaiton on the R drive will be saved for at least a few years, but might be condensed in a few years and only the important documents are maintained but as a breeding program, files tend to be saved to look back on information on different varieties. 

# Access and data sharing
There are no factors that will restrict the sharing of the data my group has produced. Although we may not publish all of our data, if someone was curious, for example, how many herbicide resistant plants we had for each generation of breeding, we could easily look that up and share it. A chart of the other desired genes that were carried through each generation of breeding may also be created. The CoAxium Wheat was originally created by Colorado Wheat Research Foundation and owns the patent on the herbicide resistance gene. Therefore, my PI had to pay a trait fee to get seeds to work with but I do not have any restrictions for my project.

Some of the data will be publicly available when I publish my thesis. The rest will be available through a supplementary file or upon request. My thesis and research has to do with a potential new breeding scheme so documenting and its progression is the most important data that I can make that publicly available once I publish my thesis. Since we created our own KASP markers to run our DNA samples (and see which genes they carry) we can share the marker and primer data. In terms of policies governing the reuse, redistribution and creation of derivatives of the data/licenses, there will not be any policies for the data I generate. There is only a limitation on sharing the germplasm we produce with other breeding institutions. Anyone who requests to use the germplasm will need a license, similar to what we had to acquire at the start of our project.

There is a server (the “R” drive) that our lab has accessed to and is backed up and supported through ROOTS. I will have control and access of my data and will be available to others in my group as well. The data will be archived and preserved forever. The formats will be in Excel, Word and StepOne files (the format that the StepOne machine uses and detects the presence of certain genes/alleles, can also export data into Excel files).
