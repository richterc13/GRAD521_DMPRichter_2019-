# Data description
Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is grown on over five million acres in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as it is one of the only economically viable crops in areas of low or intermediate rainfall. Herbicide resistant varieties are important in growing wheat in the PNW due to the highly competitive weeds such as jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) which are the leading to losses in quality and quantity. Colorado State University (CSU) developed a new source of herbicide resistance conferring resistance to Quizalofop P herbicides in wheat. Due to winter wheat’s longer life cycle compared to spring wheat, CSU’s winter herbicide resistant variety will be crossed with Oregon State University’s (OSU) spring wheat and then to OSU’s winter wheat in an attempt to speed up the breeding process. This breeding scheme will be compared to a conventional breeding scheme, where CSU’s resistant varieties are directly crossed to OSU’s winter wheat varieties until the desired resistant winter wheat that is adapted to Oregon’s climate and stressors is developed. The goal is to study whether wheat breeding schemes can be sped up by using spring wheat to decrease the amount of time needed to create a new winter wheat variety.
	To compare the speed of the two breeding schemes, data will be recorded for the dates of planting for each generation, anthesis, and harvest. This data will be studied through observation and recorded in a table with date on the x-axis and the variety on the y-axis. This dataset will be about 1 MB. In addition, genotyping the end results for various genes (about 30) such as disease resistance will be used to compare the final products of the two schemes to see if anything was gained or lost using the speed breeding method. This information will be collected through phenol-chloroform DNA extraction and KASP-PCR for the various genes and then recorded in a table stating whether the gene was present or not. This dataset will be around 2 or 3 MB, potentially more if the exact PCR results are included. This experiment will occur over the course of about two years. The study started November 2017 and has a goal end date of November 2019. 

# Roles and responsibilities
1.I am in charge of keeping track of the dates of planting, harvest and anthesis. The two lab technicians I work closely with (Lab techs 1 and 2) and I are in charge of the genotyping data. Lab techs 1 and 2 and I are all in charge of the molecular marker data and primers to identify the traits we are selecting for. Overall I do most of the data collection since it is my thesis but Lab techs 1 and 2 also help when needed and we work together for data organization. Lab tech 1 primarily does instrumentation maintenance, software creation and maintenance if needed, and access control. Lab tech 2 helps with quality control (making sure the plants stay a live and healthy with fertilizer, herbicides etc.) in order for the data collection to go smoothly. These are the main rolls while we are collecting data.

When it comes to writing and publication, my PI will step in and help with the access control of the publication as well as quality control (looking over my writing). I will be doing the metadata generation. Archiving and preservation of data will go through my PI as well as through another one of his faculty assistants. 

2.Sensitive data is data that contains private data about human subjects that is not as restrictive as confidential data, however still is private information such as employee applications.  Normally this data is at a no or minimal risk level but should still be protected.

My data is unrestricted data and can be used for general use and easily found through databases or on the internet without posing a risk to anyone since my subjects are wheat plants.

3. I am on a graduate assistantship with my PI so my lab/OSU is funding my research. My PI does not have any data management or data sharing requirements. I simply work for my advisor year-round while performing my research, therefore no contracts or disclosure agreements other than my assistant ship contract.
